# NFL_QB_Analysis

## Overview
The following repository contains a Jupyter notebook analyzing Quarterback data from 2015 - 2019. As described in the notebook, the emphasis of the data exploration was on the passing touchdown statistic. This is due to the fact that historically, NFL teams continue to rely on passing the ball instead of running the ball to win games. With the Quarterback position being the most coveted in the NFL, it is important to have a predictive model to determine how many touchdowns a Quarterback can throw in a given year. Overall, the future of this project is intended to be used by Fantasy Football analysts to help draft their teams.
